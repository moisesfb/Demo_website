# Interactive plot
First lets make a ggplot of cars, speed vs distance

```{r}
install.packages("plotly", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)

```


```{r}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
